# Capstone Memorial Site 
________________________________________________________________________
## The Memorial Summary

My Capstone has been a project in my head for over a year now. I wasn't sure where or how I would start or even that it would become a website. My Great Grandmother passed away in 2022, and I put together her memorial slide show. In doing so I received hundreds of pictures and memories from my close relatives to relatives I have not even met, there is so so many of us! I am so grateful for all of the memories my family has shared with me and because my Grandmother was our families heart I wanted a place we could all look back on and add onto as well. So this is my very special website and I can not wait to share it with you.
